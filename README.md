# Full Thrust Ship Builder

This package is still very much in development. There is still much to do, but the core features are now working as expected.

You can play with the tool at <https://www.perlkonig.com/ftShipBuilder>.

## Building Instructions

To get this working on your own machine, do the following:

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
* Clone the repo.
* From the newly cloned folder, type `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
* Then type `npm run dev` to start up the dev server.

Ideally you'd submit any changes via pull request, but if you wanted to just host your own instance, run `npm run build` and then put everything in the `dist` folder on some host somewhere.
