## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.0] - 2022-09-04

### Added

* Fleshed out the general systems.
* Added all the ordnance.

### Fixed

* Dragging should now work on mobile, but I haven't tried to adjust the code for `<g>` elements yet, so the lines and bay numbers don't reposition until you drop.

## [v0.1.0] - 2022-09-02

Initial commit. All the basic features are working, but still a ton of systems to add.
